Classic Snake Game by Python Libraries

This repository contains an implementation of the Snake Game using Python libraries such as Turtle, Random, and Time. The Snake Game is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a snake on the screen, guiding it to eat food while avoiding collisions with its own tail.

Installation:- To run the Snake Game, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you'll need to install the Turtle library, which is used for graphics, the Random library for generating random food positions, and the Time library for controlling the game's speed.

Usage:- To start the game, run the snake_game.py script. This will open a window with the game interface. Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement. The objective is to eat as much food as possible and avoid collisions. The game ends when the snake crashes into its own tail.

Customization:- Feel free to customize the game according to your preferences. You can modify aspects such as the size and speed of the snake, the appearance of the food, and the game's colors. The code is well-commented, making it easy to understand and modify.

Contribution:-Contributions to the Snake Game are welcome. If you find any issues or have ideas for enhancements, feel free to submit a pull request. Let's make this game even more enjoyable and engaging!

Credits:-This Snake Game implementation was created with the help of the Turtle, Random, and Time libraries. Special thanks to the developers and contributors of these libraries for their valuable work.

Enjoy playing the Snake Game and have a great time!
